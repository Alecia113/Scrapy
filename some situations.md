First of all I don't know what scrapy is, scrapy is a framework for crawlers.
Nor do I know how scapy works. Couldn't even read the task requirements. First find some research cases to analyze.
Found that scapy is using item + a spider.py to achieve the data from HTML. Also need to know HTML knowledge.

web url： response.url
<p>some function about response.xpath</p>
